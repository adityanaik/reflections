When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

By keeping a remote repo on sites like GitHub, we can showcase our skills and expertise to potential employers. Also it makes it possible to collaborate with other devs, in that case sites like GitHub work as a server.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A manual control of pulling the commits gives us the power to first analyze the code before making changes to the master branch.
