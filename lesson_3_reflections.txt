When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

By keeping a remote repo on sites like GitHub, we can showcase our skills and expertise to potential employers. Also it makes it possible to collaborate with other devs, in that case sites like GitHub work as a server.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A manual control of pulling the commits gives us the power to first analyze the code before making changes to the master branch.


3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - Basically making a copy of an existing GitHub repo in your GitHub account.

Clone - Making a copy of repo (or a fork of a repo) on your computer.

Branches - Making an alternate version of a master code, both of whom then exist and grow independently.

We will fork a GitHub repo if we want to make our version of it by adding/subtracting features. We will clone a repo if we want to bring it down to our local machine for easier development. We will make a branch from the master if we want to add experimental features to the project, and test them before merging into the master.
