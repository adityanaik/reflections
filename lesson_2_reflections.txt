1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running the git init command creates a .git directory in the said directory. As of now it looks like the first step in creating a git repository. The tracking commits feature will be added by a subsequent git command.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate stage between a normal working directory and a git repository. It facilitates us to add the files which need to be tracked of changes, and ignore the other files.
